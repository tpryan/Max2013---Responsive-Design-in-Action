<h1>Responsive Design in Action</h1>


<p>This is a lab on Responsive Web Design. It will take you from a static composition, to a responsive composition, to a prototype website in HTML + CSS. There will be a lot of code, specifically CSS. </p> 

<p>The website we are going to build is called "Inappropriate Intensity" an homage to people who are intense at a level not mandated by their environment.  Here is the comp:</p>

 <figure>
   <img src="img/comp.png" />
   <figcaption>Comp</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>It's a typical site with horizontal navigation, and three columns for the content. </p>


<p>We're going to walk through the design in Reflow.</p>
